    "news_article_fake = \"Title: Global Leaders Take Action on Climate Change at COP26 Summit In a historic moment for climate action, world leaders gathered at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to address the pressing issue of climate change. With the recent release of alarming reports on the state of the planet, the urgency to take bold steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming has never been greater. During the summit, countries pledged to ramp up their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. The United States announced ambitious targets to cut emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, while China committed to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. One of the key topics of discussion at the summit was the need for wealthy nations to provide financial support to developing countries to help them adapt to the effects of climate change. A new agreement was reached to increase funding for climate adaptation and resilience in vulnerable regions, signaling a step towards global solidarity in the fight against climate change. Environmental activists and youth advocates were also present at the summit, pushing for stronger commitments from world leaders to protect the planet for future generations. Greta Thunberg, the renowned climate activist, delivered a powerful speech urging leaders to act with urgency and prioritize the well-being of the planet over short-term economic interests. As the COP26 summit drew to a close, there was a sense of hope and determination among participants that real progress had been made towards addressing the climate crisis. While the road ahead is challenging, the collective efforts of global leaders and activists have set a new course towards a more sustainable and resilient future for all.\""
